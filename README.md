## Development Environment

### Running Local

#### Installing yarn

This package uses `yarn` for managing dependencies.
If you don't have it installed, you can install it with `npm`.

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

#### Building the Development Environment

1. The first step is to clone the project, which means that you will create a local copy of the source code repository
   in your computer. This is a common practice when working with version control systems like Git.

2. The second step is to install the dependencies of the project by running the `yarn install` command in the folder of
   the web application. This command will download and install all the required packages and libraries listed in the
   project's `package.json` file. If you don't have yarn installed, the instructions recommend installing it with NPM (
   Node Package Manager).

3. The third step is to start the project by running the `yarn dev` command. This will launch the development server and
   the React application will be available in your web browser at the specified URL.

Note that the terminal will say where the project is ready to be accessed.

Example:

```
  VITE v4.2.1  ready in 643 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5174/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
